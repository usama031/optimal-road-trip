# Optimal Road Trip

**Optimal Road Trip** is a Python-based project that uses algorithms and data science techniques to optimize the route planning for road trips. The goal of this project is to help users plan their road trips by minimizing travel time, cost, or distance based on their preferences and conditions like fuel efficiency, road types, or rest stops.

## Introduction

Planning a road trip can be overwhelming, especially when trying to find the optimal route. The **Optimal Road Trip** project is designed to assist travelers in selecting the best route using multiple factors such as:

- **Distance**: The shortest route based on geographical distance.
- **Travel Time**: The fastest route based on average speed, traffic conditions, and road types.
- **Cost**: A route that minimizes fuel consumption based on vehicle type, fuel efficiency, and distance.
- **Rest Stops**: Incorporating necessary rest stops to ensure a comfortable journey.

The project uses real-time data from sources like **Google Maps API** and **OpenStreetMap** to provide up-to-date and accurate route information.

## Features

- **Route Optimization**: Automatically calculates the most optimal route based on travel time, cost, or distance.
- **Multiple Parameters**: Optimize routes considering multiple factors such as vehicle fuel efficiency, speed limits, and number of rest stops.
- **Dynamic Re-Routing**: Update routes based on real-time traffic conditions, road closures, or accidents.
- **Cost Estimation**: Estimate the fuel cost for the road trip based on the chosen route and the vehicle's fuel efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the route on a map to get a better understanding of the road trip.
